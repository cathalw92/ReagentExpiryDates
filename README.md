## Reagent Expirartion Dates
Will return the expiration date for a reagent based on user input.

## Motivation
I wanted my first Java project to be based off a real world problem. As a chemist, whenever we use a new reagent we have to check the manufacurers documentation and assign the reagent an expiry date. I made this to save time when doing that and also to give the exact day it will expire. 

## Build status
Still in progress, more reagents to be added. 

## Current Reagents
THF, Acetonitrile, Acetone, Mobile Phase A, Seal Wash, SST2.

## Run Instructions
Runs in ECLIPSE, import using import wizard.
