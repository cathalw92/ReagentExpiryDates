# ReagentExpiryDates
Returns expiry dates for reagents based on user input

I wanted my first project to be based on a real life problem I had. Currently working as a chemist, once we open a new reagent we assign it an expiry date.
To save time in checking the manufacturers/ in-house documentation for the expiry dates and working out what date that will expire, I made this project.
This project, will give the expiration date for the reagent that you input.
 Currently the only reagents listed are:
 THF (tetrohydrofuran)
 Acetonitrile
 Acetone
 Mobile phase A
 Seal Wash
 SST2
 More to come!!
