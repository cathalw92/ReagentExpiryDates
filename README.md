## Reagent Expirartion Dates
Will return the expiration date for a reagent based on user input

## Motivation
I wanted my first Java project to be based off a real world problem. As a chemist, whenver we use a new reagent we have to check the manufacurers documentation an assign the reagent an expiry date. I made this to save time when doing that and also to give the exact day it will expire. 

## Build status
Still in progress, more reagents to be added. Will imporve code as I improve
